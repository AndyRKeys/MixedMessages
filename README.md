## General Information
- requirements for project: a message generator program that outputs a new, random message every time a user runs the program
- how I've chosen to meet the requirements: a virtual character generator (as if for an RPG game) - each time it is run it will generate two new random characters and output their stats to the console.
- to showcase basic JavaScript syntax and programming concepts
- undertaken as part of Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer PRO course
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
